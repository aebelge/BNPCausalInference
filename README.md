# BNPCausalInference

My bachelor's thesis on Bayesian nonparametric causal inference, along with the code for the custom `bnpmediation()` function.

The original version of `bnpmediation()` from the BNPMediation R package depends on `DPdensity()` from the now-orphaned DPpackage. This version removes that dependency.

A detailed explanation of what the function does can be found in Section 6.3 of the paper.
